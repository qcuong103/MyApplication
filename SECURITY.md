## Security

We take security very seriously. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code and dependencies to ensure nobody's use of the application is ever compromised or hacked.

### Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the developers time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. Please email us directly at `protect.github@gmail.com` with details and steps to reproduce. Security issues take precedence over bug fixes and feature work.
